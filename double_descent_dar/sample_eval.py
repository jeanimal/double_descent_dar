    """
    Samples the same num_sampled_rows from X and y and sample num_sampled_columns from X.

    Returns a tuple of the sampled X and y with matched rows, so they must have the same number of rows.

    Sampling is can be with or without replacement based on the boolean value of replace.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X
        DataFrame to sample. If replace=False, must have shape >= (num_sampled_rows, num_sampled_columns).
    y
        Single-column dataFrame to sample. If replace=False, must have shape > (num_sampled_rows, 1).
    num_sampled_rows
        Integer number of rows to sample.
    num_sampled_columns
        Integer number of columns to sample.
    random_state
        Integer random state for the random sample, useful for reproducible testing.  Do not set in production.
    replace
        Whether to sample with replacement

    Returns
    -------
    X, y
        Sampled version of the input dataframes where X.shape == (num_sampled_rows, num_sampled_columns) and y.shape == (num_sampled_rows, 1)
